# Aphor

Created a social network from scratch for users to write collections of poems and short stories; using Next.js (React.js and Node.js) and TypeScript.
Implemented custom authentication with NextAuth.js and own database with MongoDB. Also, styled components with SCSS and unit-tested code with Jest.
