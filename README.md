# Aphor

Fullstack social network where users can write books in real time, like aphorisms, poems and short stories! Built with TypeScript and SCSS, in Next.js. Fetching data from own API. Unit testing with Jest. 

Backend runs on Node and MongoDB, athenticating users by own credentials with JWT, (thanks to NextAuth).
